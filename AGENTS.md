# resonance-landing — Agent Rules

Resonance Ventures landing site at resonance-ventures.com, hosted on GitHub Pages with Cloudflare DNS.

## Read first

Before meaningful work, every agent must read:

1. `PROJECT_STATE.md`
2. This `AGENTS.md`
3. `CLAUDE.md` (project-specific rules)
4. `DESIGN.md` / `PRODUCT.md` for brand context
5. Obsidian project page: `[[resonance-landing]]`

## Source of truth

- Current implementation: this repo deployed via GitHub Pages.
- DNS: Cloudflare (mirrors Drop DNS setup).
- Current handoff: `PROJECT_STATE.md`.
- Cross-project memory: Obsidian project page.

## Operating rules

1. Static site — keep it fast and accessible.
2. Never commit secrets or API keys.
3. Run Playwright tests before declaring work done.
4. Cloudflare DNS changes require Arya approval before applying.
5. Update `PROJECT_STATE.md` after meaningful work.

## Validation

```bash
npm test
npx playwright test
```

## Multi-Agent Handoff Protocol
Worked on by multiple agents (Claude, Codex, Hermes), possibly concurrently.
### Start
1. Read PROJECT_STATE.md; check live claims: `python3 ~/Developer/agent-stack/scripts/session_claim.py list`.
2. Sessions auto-isolate in their own worktree (dev-session.zsh) — no global lock. If a live claim already covers the feature you intended, pick different work or coordinate.
3. Record Working on (<feature> on <branch>) in PROJECT_STATE.md SESSION LOCK.
### End
1. Commit/push your code (or open a PR via ship.sh).
2. Update PROJECT_STATE.md: add a Recent-sessions entry; update Exact next step; set SESSION LOCK status.
3. The vault mirrors PROJECT_STATE.md automatically (now per-branch).
